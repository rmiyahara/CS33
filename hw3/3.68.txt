By observing the assembly lines, and drawing the memory diagrams for str1 and
str2, I found the following 4 equations.

1) B + buffer1 = 8
2) B + buffer1 + 4 + 2A + buffer2 = 32
3) 4AB + buffer3 = 184
4) buffer1 = (4 - B%4); //if equal to 4, this is changed to 0
5) buffer2 = (8 - 2A%8); //if this is equal to 8, this is changed to 0
6) buffer3 = (8 - 4AB%8); If this is equal to 8, this is changed to 0

By solving these system of equations, I got the following values.
A = 9;
B = 5;
I checked these values by plugging them back into the equations.
