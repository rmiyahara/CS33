A. False, in the case that x = TMax, the left side will be NaN while the int
to double cast on the right ill give a valid number. the answer will be
rounded when cast to a float after. NaN != any number.

B. False, if x = TMin and y is any positive numberm the right will overflow
while the left side does not.

C. True, since a double has twice the amount of bytes of an int, we can never
overflow. This means addition starting with any two factors will be the same.

D. False, if x = TMax, y = TMax - 2, and dz = 2^-1, the left side would
produce a rounding error in the first operation while it would be produced in
the second operation on the right. The rounding errors will more often than
not, be different.

E. False, if x = 0 and z = any number, the left would equal NaN while the right
would equal 1.
